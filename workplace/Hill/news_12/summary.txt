It is the most common cause of dementia, mainly affecting people over the age of 65. There is no cure, but medications and therapies can help manage symptoms. The disease has various stages, with symptoms worsening over time. Early-onset Alzheimer's can occur in people in their 40s or 50s, but it is rare.
