Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK, affecting memory, thinking skills, and other mental abilities. It primarily affects older individuals but can also occur in younger people. Symptoms include memory problems, confusion, and personality changes. Diagnosis can be challenging, but early detection is important for planning and receiving appropriate treatment. While there is no cure, medications and support services can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Lifestyle factors may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Research is ongoing, and support and resources are available for those affected by dementia.
