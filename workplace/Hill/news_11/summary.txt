Mayo Clinic provides information on diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease, including using biomarker tests to detect plaques and tangles in the brain. Diagnostic tests include physical exams, lab tests, and brain imaging. Researchers are developing blood tests for more accurate diagnosis. Genetic testing is recommended for those with a family history of early-onset Alzheimer's. Treatments include medications to help with symptoms and slow decline, with potential side effects such as gastrointestinal issues and brain complications. Regular brain MRIs are recommended during treatment.
