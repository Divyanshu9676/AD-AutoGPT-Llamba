Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, judgment, language, personality, and movement. It advances through stages from preclinical to severe dementia, with early detection being crucial for potential treatments. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty with tasks, changes in behavior, and decline in communication and physical abilities. The rate of progression varies, with common causes of death including pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition, falls, and infections.
