Mayo Clinic provides information on diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease, including using biomarker tests to detect plaques and tangles in the brain. Diagnostic tests include physical exams, lab tests, and brain imaging. Researchers are developing blood tests for more accurate diagnosis. Treatments include medications to manage symptoms and slow decline, with potential side effects and risks for certain individuals. Regular brain MRIs are recommended during treatment.
