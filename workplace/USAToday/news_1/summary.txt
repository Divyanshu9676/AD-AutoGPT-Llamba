Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition that affects memory, thinking, judgment, language, and movement. It progresses through stages from preclinical to severe dementia, with early detection being important for potential treatment. Mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia are early indicators of the disease, while moderate and severe dementia stages involve significant memory loss and decline in mental and physical abilities. The rate of progression varies, with common causes of death including pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition, falls, and infections.
