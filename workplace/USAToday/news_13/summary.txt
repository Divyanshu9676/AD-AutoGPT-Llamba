Alzheimer's Disease is a common form of dementia that is not a normal part of aging. Prevention strategies include staying physically active, following a Mediterranean diet, engaging in intellectually stimulating activities, and protecting against traumatic brain injury. Diagnosis involves excluding other reasons for symptoms, with new tools being developed for earlier detection. While there is no cure, treatments are available to improve symptoms and quality of life. Management includes medication, a healthy lifestyle, support systems, and participation in research. Researchers at Johns Hopkins are making advancements in early detection and understanding the progression of the disease.
