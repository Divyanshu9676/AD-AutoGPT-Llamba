Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive brain condition that causes memory loss, thinking difficulties, and affects daily activities. It is the most common cause of dementia, mainly affecting people over the age of 65. There is no cure, but medications and therapies can help manage symptoms. The stages of Alzheimer's vary for each individual, with symptoms worsening over time. Diagnosis involves tests to differentiate Alzheimer's from other conditions with similar symptoms.
