Dementia is a decline in mental ability that affects memory, thinking, and behavior, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common type. Other types include vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. Risk factors include genetics and lifestyle habits, but can be reduced through physical activity and blood pressure control. Symptoms vary depending on the type of dementia, and early diagnosis is important for effective treatment. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion offers information and resources for Alzheimer's disease and dementia, emphasizing the importance of public health initiatives and prevention strategies.
