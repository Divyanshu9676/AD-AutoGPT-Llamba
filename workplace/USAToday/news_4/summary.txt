Alzheimer's dementia is diagnosed through a series of tests conducted by healthcare professionals to measure memory impairment, thinking skills, functional abilities, and behavior changes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment and planning for the future. Early symptoms include memory impairment, difficulty with daily tasks, confusion, language issues, and changes in mood and behavior. Diagnosis involves a thorough evaluation of symptoms, medical history, cognitive skills, and ruling out other conditions. Tests may include physical exams, lab tests, brain imaging, and memory testing. Researchers are working on new tests to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier, and an early diagnosis can help individuals and their families prepare for the challenges of the disease.
