Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that leads to memory loss, changes in behavior, and difficulties in performing daily tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. While there is no cure, medications and support programs can help manage symptoms. Early intervention is important, as the disease begins years before symptoms appear. Age is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's, and research is focused on understanding the role of certain proteins in its development. If concerned about a loved one's cognitive abilities, it is important to seek medical advice and support.
