Alzheimer's Disease is a common form of dementia that is not a normal part of aging. Prevention strategies include staying physically active, following a Mediterranean diet, engaging in intellectually stimulating activities, and protecting against traumatic brain injury. Diagnosis is based on symptoms such as memory loss and confusion, with new tools being developed for early detection. While there is no cure, treatments are available to improve symptoms and quality of life. Management involves medication, support systems, regular activities, exercise, sleep, and emotional support. Research at Johns Hopkins focuses on early detection and understanding the disease progression. Caregivers should encourage independence and provide structure for those with Alzheimer's.
