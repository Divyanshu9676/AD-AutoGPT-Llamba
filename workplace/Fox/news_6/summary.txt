Dementia is a decline in mental ability that affects memory, thinking, and behavior, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common type. Other types include vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia. Risk factors include genetics and lifestyle habits, but can be reduced through physical activity and blood pressure control. Symptoms of dementia vary and early diagnosis is important for effective treatment. The National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion offers resources for managing Alzheimer's and dementia.
