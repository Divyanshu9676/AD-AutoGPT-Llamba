Alzheimer's dementia is diagnosed through a series of tests conducted by healthcare professionals to measure memory impairment, thinking skills, functional abilities, and behavior changes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment and planning for the future. Early symptoms include memory impairment, confusion, language issues, and mood changes. Diagnosis involves physical exams, cognitive tests, ruling out other conditions, and gathering information from family and friends. Additional tests such as lab tests and brain imaging may be ordered. Researchers are working on new tests to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier, and an early diagnosis can help individuals and their families prepare for the challenges of the disease.
