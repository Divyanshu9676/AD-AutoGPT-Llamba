Updated on October 9, 2024FactsSymptomsDiagnosisMedicationOther treatmentsCauses and risk factorsStagesAlzheimer’s careTakeawayAlzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia, which is a broader category of conditions that negatively affect memory, thinking, and behavior. Dementia can have a range of causes, such as brain injuries or diseases. Sometimes the cause is unknown. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60% to 80% of dementia cases.Most people with the disease get a diagnosis after 65 years of age. If it’s diagnosed before then, it’s generally referred to as “younger onset” or “early onset” Alzheimer’s disease.There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, but there are treatments that can slow the progression of the disease.Alzheimer’s factsAlthough many people have heard of Alzheimer’s disease, it’s helpful to know the facts. Here are some key details about this condition:Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic (long-term), ongoing condition. It is not a typical sign of aging.Alzheimer’s and dementia are not the same thing. Alzheimer’s disease is a type of dementia.The symptoms come on gradually, and the effects on the brain are degenerative, meaning they cause slow decline.Anyone can get Alzheimer’s disease, but certain people are at higher risk of developing it. This includes people over 65 years old and those with a family history of the condition.There’s no single expected outcome for people with Alzheimer’s. Some people live a long time with mild cognitive damage, while others experience a more rapid onset of symptoms and quicker disease progression.There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s yet, but treatment can help slow the progression of the disease and may improve quality of life.Each person’s journey with Alzheimer’s disease is different. Symptoms of Alzheimer’s diseaseEveryone has episodes of forgetfulness from time to time. But people with Alzheimer’s disease display certain ongoing behaviors and symptoms that progress over time. These can include:memory loss that affects daily activities such as keeping appointmentstrouble with familiar tasks such as using a microwavedifficulties with problem-solvingtrouble with speech or writingdisorientation in relation to times or placesdecreased judgmentdecreased personal hygienemood and personality changeswithdrawal from friends, family, and communityThese symptoms don’t always mean that someone has Alzheimer’s. It’s important to consult a doctor to determine the cause.The symptoms change according to the stage of the disease. In later stages, people with Alzheimer’s often have significant trouble with talking, moving, and responding to what’s happening around them.Diagnosing Alzheimer’s diseaseThe only definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease is to examine someone’s brain tissue after death. But a doctor can use other examinations and tests to assess your mental abilities, diagnose dementia, and rule out other conditions.The doctor will likely start by taking a medical history. They may ask about your:symptomsfamily medical historycurrent or past health conditionscurrent or past medicationsdiet, alcohol intake, and other lifestyle factorsFrom there, your doctor will likely request several tests to help them find out whether you have Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimer’s medicationThere’s no known cure for Alzheimer’s disease and no way to prevent it. However, your doctor can recommend medications and other treatments to help ease your symptoms and delay the progression of the disease for as long as possible.Common medications include:donepezil (Aricept)rivastigmine (Exelon)aducanumab (Lecanemab)memantine (Namenda)Your doctor may also recommend antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, or antipsychotics to help treat symptoms related to Alzheimer’s. These symptoms vary depending on the progression of the disease but can include:depressiondifficulty sleeping at nightagitationhallucinationsAlthough the care needs of someone with Alzheimer’s will increase over time, the exact symptoms will be different from person to person.Other Alzheimer’s treatmentsAlong with your doctor, a team of healthcare professionals can help you maintain your quality of life at all stages of Alzheimer’s disease. A care team for Alzheimer’s may include:a physical therapist to help you stay activea dietitian to help you maintain a balanced, nutritious dieta speech therapist to help you maintain communication skillsa mental health professional specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy to help you manage depression and anxiety symptomsa pharmacist to help with monitoring medicationsother mental health professionals, who may work with people with Alzheimer’s and their caregiversa social worker to help with you and your loved ones access resources and supporta respite care center, which provides short-term care for people with Alzheimer’s when their caregivers are temporarily unavailablea hospice care center to manage symptoms in a comfortable and supportive setting at the end of lifeIn addition to lifestyle changes, there are several alternative and complementary therapies you can ask your doctor about. Alzheimer’s disease causes and risk factorsExperts have not found one specific cause of Alzheimer’s disease, but they have identified certain risk factors, including:Older age: Most people who develop Alzheimer’s disease are 65 years of age or older.Family history: If you have an immediate family member who has developed the condition, you’re more likely to develop it.Genetics: Certain genes — particularly apolipoprotein E (APOE) — have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.Having one or more of these risk factors does not mean that you’ll develop Alzheimer’s disease. It simply increases your risk.Other possible risk factors include a history of: depressionsmokingcardiovascular diseasetraumatic brain injuryTo learn more about your personal risk of developing Alzheimer’s, talk with your doctor. Alzheimer’s stagesAlzheimer’s is a progressive disease, which means the symptoms will gradually increase over time. People with Alzheimer’s typically live for 4 to 8 years after diagnosis, though some live for up to 20 years.There are seven main stages of Alzheimer’s. The first three stages are classified as pre-dementia and mild cognitive impairment, and the last four stages are when Alzheimer’s is typically diagnosed. In the final stage of Alzheimer’s, there is usually a progressive loss of speech and facial expressions, and movement is likely to become limited as well.Talk with your doctor about strategies for managing these changes. Appropriate care can help you maintain comfort and quality of life for as long as possible. Alzheimer’s careAs Alzheimer’s disease progresses, people need more support to complete tasks of daily living. If you have a loved one with Alzheimer’s, it’s important to start learning about what to expect and what your role in their future care may be. Caregiving is a role that’s typically not easy, but it can also be very rewarding.If your loved one has Alzheimer’s, here are some ways to plan and prepare for caregiving:Educate yourself about Alzheimer’s, its stages, and its typical symptoms. By reading this article, you’re already on the right track.Connect with family members who can step in to help.Consider joining a support group for dementia caregivers.Look up professional home care, respite care, and adult day care programs in your area.Remember that you’ll need support too. Reach out to the people you’re close to and be open to accepting help.As a caregiver, it’s important to take care of yourself as well as your loved one. Caregiving has difficult moments, and the strain of ongoing responsibilities can negatively affect your health. As much as possible, a robust care plan should include support for yourself too.The takeawayAlzheimer’s is a complicated disease, and scientists are working on unlocking its secrets. Living a healthy lifestyle may help prevent it. And if you have a family history of Alzheimer’s, it’s important to discuss it with your doctor.By the time Alzheimer‘s is diagnosed, the progression of the disease can’t be stopped. But treatment can help delay symptoms and improve your quality of life. If you think you or a loved one may have Alzheimer’s, talk with a doctor. They can make a diagnosis, discuss what you can expect, and connect you with services and support. If you’re interested, they can also give you information about taking part in clinical trials.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHistoryHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
