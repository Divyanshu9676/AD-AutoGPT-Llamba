The drug lecanemab has shown promising results in slowing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients by removing amyloid-beta from the body. Research is ongoing to explore the benefits of administering the drug earlier in the disease progression and potentially using drug cocktails targeting both tau and amyloid. Multi-drug trials are seen as the next step in treatment, with potential side effects including brain swelling and bleeding. Overall, the impact on patients has been positive, offering hope for slowing down the progression of the disease.
