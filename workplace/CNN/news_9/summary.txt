Researchers are exploring new approaches to treat Alzheimer's disease beyond targeting amyloid plaques, including boosting the immune system, removing toxic protein tangles, and stimulating brain waves with light and sound. Focus on alternative strategies at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference suggests amyloid drugs alone may not be enough. One promising target is the protein tau, responsible for toxic tangles in brain cells. Denali has developed a drug delivery system targeting tau tangles, while MIT found that boosting gamma waves through light and sound therapy can improve learning and memory in mice with Alzheimer's. Boosting the immune system may slow or reverse the progression of the disease. Tansey's lab is researching ways to enhance immune cell function to combat Alzheimer's.
