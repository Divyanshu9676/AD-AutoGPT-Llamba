The FDA has approved a new Alzheimer's treatment called lecanemab, which has been shown to slow cognitive decline in early-stage cases of the disease. The drug works by removing a protein believed to cause Alzheimer's. It is the first treatment to show a slowing of decline in Alzheimer's and the first drug for the disease to receive FDA approval in two decades. However, there are safety concerns with a "black box" warning. A trial showed a 27% slowing of clinical decline compared to a placebo. Common side effects include infusion reactions and brain abnormalities. The drug may cost $26,500 per year, with Medicare covering 80% of the cost. Further studies are needed to determine long-term effects. Yale Medicine offers specialized care for Alzheimer's, MS, and dementia, with expert specialists and advanced imaging for diagnosis. Therapy and counseling are available, and the website provides information on related topics and contact information for referrals and donations.
