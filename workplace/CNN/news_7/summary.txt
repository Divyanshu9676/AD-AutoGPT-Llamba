The FDA has approved Leqembi, the first drug to slow down Alzheimer's disease progression. Medicare coverage is expected to follow, making the drug more accessible. Leqembi has shown to slow memory and thinking declines by 27% and reduce beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. It is expected to cost $26,500 a year and is seen as a significant advancement in Alzheimer's treatment. However, Medicare coverage for the drug is limited due to potential side effects and lack of healthcare system preparedness.
