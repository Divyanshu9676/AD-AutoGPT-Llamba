Alzheimer's dementia is diagnosed through a series of tests conducted by healthcare professionals to measure memory impairment, thinking skills, functional abilities, and behavior changes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment and planning for the future. Early symptoms include memory impairment, difficulty with daily tasks, confusion, language issues, and changes in mood and behavior. Diagnosis involves physical exams, cognitive tests, ruling out other conditions, and gathering information from family and friends. Researchers are working on new tests to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier, and an early diagnosis can help individuals and families prepare for the challenges of the disease.
