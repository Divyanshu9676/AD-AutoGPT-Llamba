Alzheimer's Disease is a common form of dementia that is not a normal part of aging. Prevention strategies include staying physically active, following a Mediterranean diet, engaging in intellectually stimulating activities, and protecting against traumatic brain injury. Diagnosis involves excluding other reasons for symptoms, with new tools being developed for earlier detection. While there is no cure, treatments are available to improve symptoms and quality of life. Management involves treating symptoms with medications, creating a support system, maintaining regular activities, exercising, getting enough sleep, and seeking emotional support. Research at Johns Hopkins is focused on early detection and understanding the progression of the disease. Caregivers should encourage independence and provide structure for those with Alzheimer's.
