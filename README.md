# AD-AutoGPT (using Llamba): An AI Assistant for Alzheimer's Disease Research

This project, **AD-AutoGPT**, leverages OpenAI's GPT model and LangChain to provide assistance in Alzheimer's disease research. By integrating various tools, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and geographical data visualization, the tool aims to aid researchers and healthcare professionals in understanding and analyzing data relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

The project incorporates an autonomous information retrieval system using an LLaMA-based language model. This system is structured similarly to autonomous AI agents like AutoGPT and includes functionalities for searching, summarizing information, storing results, and presenting them to users, enhancing efficiency and accessibility in Alzheimer's research.
